    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. 
        They said,<br>
        <q class="quote villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q><br>
        The farmer said, <br> 
        <q class="quote farmer"><strong> <a href="https://memegenerator.net/instance/74617400/peter-parker-spider-man-mayyyybe" target="_blank"><span title="Click me">Maybe.</span></a></strong></q></p> 
        <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, 
            and in the evening everybody came back and said, <br> 
            <q class="quote villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> <br> 
            The farmer again said, <br> 
            <q class="quote farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p> 

        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
            The neighbors then said, <br>
            <q class="quote villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q><br> 
            and the farmer responded, <br> 
            <q class="quote farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p> 
        <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <br> 
            <q class="quote villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> <br> Again, he said, <br> 
            <q class="quote farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></p>
        
        <blockquote class="quote" class="human" name="Alan Watts" nationality="British" origin="UK" job="philospher"><p>
            "The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span>
            or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; 
            or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune."
